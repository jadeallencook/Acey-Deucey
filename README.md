# Acey Deucey

Acey-deucey is a variant of backgammon believed to be rooted in the Middle East, Greece, or Turkey, where there were variants in which the game started with pieces off the board. Compared to standard backgammon, acey-deucey is more like a race than a strategy game. It features a differing starting position, opening play, and rules for the endgame. Because pieces may be retained in one's opponent's home board, the game offers substantial opportunities for backgame play.
